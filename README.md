-HTML (The Skeleton): It builds the structure. Like the bones of our form - the boxes for text, the buttons, the labels.
-CSS (The Artist): It makes everything look pretty! Colors, fonts, sizes, and layout. It gives our skeleton some style.
-JavaScript (The Brain): It makes our form smart! It can check if your password is strong, or if you typed your email correctly.
